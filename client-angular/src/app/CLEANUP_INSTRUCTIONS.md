# Cleanup Instructions - COMPLETED

✅ **Cleanup Status: All tasks completed**

As part of the standardization of Angular component file naming conventions, the following files have been deleted as they were no longer used:

1. ✅ `/Users/oivindlund/date-night-app/client-angular/src/app/app.component.new.html` - DELETED
2. ✅ `/Users/oivindlund/date-night-app/client-angular/src/app/app.component.new.css` - DELETED
3. ✅ `/Users/oivindlund/date-night-app/client-angular/src/app/app.component.css` - DELETED

These files were previously used but have been replaced with standard Angular naming conventions:
- `app.component.html` (instead of app.component.new.html)
- `app.component.scss` (instead of app.component.new.css)

The application has been updated to use these standard files, and the old files are no longer referenced in the codebase.

## Implementation Progress

- [x] Cleanup of unused files
- [x] Implementation of Emerald.js components
  - [x] AppCard for advertiser cards
  - [x] Label for online/offline status
  - [x] Avatar with dropdown menu
  - [x] Carousel for photo galleries
  - [x] InfoPanel for advertiser information
  - [x] PageHeader for advertiser pages
  - [x] SkeletonLoader for content loading
  - [x] Toggle for light/dark mode

## Next Steps

The Emerald.js UI components have been implemented as standalone Angular components. The next steps are:

1. Update existing components to use the new Emerald.js components
2. Test the integration to ensure everything works correctly
3. Update documentation to reflect the new components

## Usage Examples

### AppCard Component

```html
<emerald-app-card
  [ad]="adItem"
  layout="netflix"
  [isOnline]="adItem.isOnline"

  (chat)="onChat($event)"
  (share)="onShare($event)">
</emerald-app-card>
```

### Avatar Component
