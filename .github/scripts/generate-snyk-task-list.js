 * Input files:
 *   - snyk-root-results.json, snyk-server-results.json, snyk-client-results.json
 *   - npm-root-deps-tree.json, npm-server-deps-tree.json, npm-client-deps-tree.json
 *   - snyk-root-upgrade-paths.json, snyk-server-upgrade-paths.json, snyk-client-upgrade-paths.json
 *
 * Output files:
 *   - downloaded-reports/snyk/prioritized-issues.md
 *   - downloaded-reports/snyk/issues-summary.md
