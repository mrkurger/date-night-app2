Integrated LLM Development Protocol (ILDP)

1. Context Initialization & Retrieval
	‚Ä¢	At the start of every job/interaction:
	‚Ä¢	Retrieve relevant project context from memory using available search tools.
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize: active projects, recent progress, technical decisions, unresolved blockers, developer preferences.
	‚Ä¢	Always assume the primary interaction is with a developer unless otherwise stated.

‚∏ª

2. Task Planning & Execution (Sequential Thinking Framework)
	‚Ä¢	When task complexity warrants:
	‚Ä¢	Break work into manageable components using structured analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Requirements: objectives, constraints, architecture fit.
	‚Ä¢	Solution Space: approaches, trade-offs, risks.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation: steps, order, testing, rollback plan.
	‚Ä¢	For every step:
	‚Ä¢	Update the memory graph with:
	‚Ä¢	Status, blockers, decisions, new milestones.
	‚Ä¢	New patterns, bugs and fixes, technology insights.
	‚Ä¢	Indicators for rethinking approach: scope changes, new constraints, emerging better solutions.

‚∏ª

3. Coding and Quality Enforcement
	‚Ä¢	Always use absolute file paths in terminal commands.
	‚Ä¢	After code edits or implementations:
	‚Ä¢	Run linting tools (e.g., npm run lint)
	‚Ä¢	Type check TypeScript (tsc --noEmit)
	‚Ä¢	For frontend-related changes:
	‚Ä¢	Execute Playwright end-to-end tests.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure functionality, regression safety, UI correctness.

4. Project Structure Reference (Hardcoded Context)
	‚Ä¢	/client_angular2/: Next.js frontend (primary)
	‚Ä¢	/client-angular/: Angular frontend (legacy/secondary)

‚∏ª

5. Developer Memory and Technical Knowledge Graph
	‚Ä¢	Actively store the following categories:
	‚Ä¢	Technical Profile: languages, frameworks, tools, standards.
	‚Ä¢	Project Context: repositories, architecture, dependencies, team.
	‚Ä¢	Problem-Solving Patterns: debug steps, solution paths, failures.
	‚Ä¢	Workflow Methods: CI/CD, version control, review process.

‚∏ª

6. Adaptive Problem-Type Strategies
	‚Ä¢	Debugging: trace ‚Üí isolate root cause ‚Üí fix ‚Üí verify
	‚Ä¢	Feature Development: requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí build ‚Üí test
	‚Ä¢	Performance: profile ‚Üí identify bottlenecks ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí validate
	‚Ä¢	Integration: interface mapping ‚Üí data flow ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí end-to-end test

‚∏ª

7. Reasoning Capture & Documentation
	‚Ä¢	For any important decision:
	‚Ä¢	Record rationale, alternatives considered, and why the final choice was made.
	‚Ä¢	Validate final solution:
	‚Ä¢	All constraints met? Integration smooth? Regression avoided?

‚∏ª

8. Final Checklist for Each Request
	‚Ä¢	Search memory for context ‚Üí Plan via sequential analysis (if complex)
‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Run lint/type checks ‚Üí Run tests (if needed) ‚Üí Update memory with progress & knowledge

‚∏ª

üîÅ REMEMBER:
	‚Ä¢	Use fill prop OR define explicit width/height on all Next.js <Image> components.
	‚Ä¢	Capture technical insights and decisions as they happen, not just at the end.

‚∏ª

üîÑ This Protocol Enables:
	‚Ä¢	LLMs to operate as structured technical co-pilots
	‚Ä¢	Continuously improving problem-solving intelligence
	‚Ä¢	Transparent, traceable, and adaptive development process
