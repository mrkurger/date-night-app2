# Testing Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the testing infrastructure for the Date Night App.

## 1. Fixed RxJS Dependency Issues

### Problem
- Multiple versions of RxJS in the dependency tree causing type compatibility issues
- Tests failing due to version conflicts

### Solution
- Added RxJS override in package.json to ensure consistent version (7.8.1)
- Ran npm dedupe to remove duplicate packages
- Resolved type compatibility issues between different versions

  - Added tests for subscription cleanup
  - Improved test documentation

- Created LocationService test with complete API coverage
  - Added tests for API success and failure scenarios
  - Added tests for fallback to local data
  - Added tests for private methods
  - Added tests for edge cases

### Test Configuration
- Created missing Karma configuration file
  - Added random port assignment for test server
  - Configured coverage reporting
  - Set up browser configuration

## 3. End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### Configuration
- Created Cypress configuration with random port assignment
- Implemented custom commands for common operations
- Set up support files for test utilities

### Test Scenarios
- Authentication Flow
