   - PWA setup component: `/client_angular2/components/pwa/pwa-setup.tsx`
   - PWA service: `/client_angular2/services/pwa.service.ts`
   - Manifest file: `/client_angular2/public/manifest.json`
   - Offline page: `/client_angular2/app/offline/page.tsx`

5. **Image Optimization API**
   - Located at: `/client_angular2/app/api/image-optimize/route.ts`
   - Server-side image processing

6. **Mock Data Service**
   - Located at: `/client_angular2/services/mock-advertisers.ts`
   - Generates 25 advertiser profiles for testing

### Main Page
The carousel is integrated into: `/client_angular2/app/carousely/page.tsx`

## How to Run the Application

To start the Next.js development server:

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the client_angular2 directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/oivindlund/date-night-app/client_angular2
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/carousely
   ```

## Testing the PWA Features

1. **Geolocation**
   - Click the compass icon in the top right
   - Allow location permission when prompted

2. **Notifications**
   - Click the bell icon in the top right
   - Allow notification permission when prompted

3. **Offline Support**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab > Service Workers
   - Check "Offline" checkbox
   - Refresh the page to test offline experience

   - The PWA installation prompt will appear
   - Click "Install" to add as an app

## Potential Issues & Solutions

1. **Image Loading Issues**
   - Check console for CORS errors
   - Ensure the image optimization API is working

2. **Touch Gestures Not Working**
   - Test with different browsers (Chrome is recommended)
   - Check console for any errors related to touch events

3. **Service Worker Registration Failure**
   - Verify the service worker is registered in Application tab
   - Check that the manifest is properly loaded

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace mock data with real API calls
   - Implement user authentication and profile storage

2. **Animation Refinements**
   - Fine-tune carousel animations for smoother transitions
   - Optimize for low-end devices

3. **Extended PWA Features**
   - Implement push notification messaging
