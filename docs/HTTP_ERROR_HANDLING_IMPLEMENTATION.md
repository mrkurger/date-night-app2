## Implementation Details

### HttpErrorInterceptor

The `HttpErrorInterceptor` is implemented as an Angular HTTP interceptor that handles all HTTP errors in a centralized way. It provides the following features:

1. **Configurable Retry Logic**: The interceptor can be configured to retry failed requests with exponential backoff. The number of retry attempts and the base delay can be configured.

2. **Error Categorization**: The interceptor categorizes errors based on their HTTP status code and provides standardized error messages for each category.

3. **User Notifications**: The interceptor shows user-friendly error notifications using the `NotificationService`.

4. **Authentication Handling**: For 401 errors, the interceptor automatically redirects the user to the login page.

5. **Error Logging**: The interceptor logs detailed error information to the console, including the error code, message, and request details.

6. **Sanitization**: The interceptor sanitizes sensitive information in error logs, such as passwords and tokens.

7. **Telemetry Integration**: The interceptor tracks errors and performance metrics using the `TelemetryService`.

### TelemetryService

The `TelemetryService` is responsible for tracking errors and performance metrics. It provides the following features:

1. **Error Tracking**: The service tracks errors with detailed information, including the error code, message, URL, and request details.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: The service tracks performance metrics for HTTP requests, including the duration, response size, and request details.

3. **Offline Support**: The service stores telemetry data locally when offline and sends it when the connection is restored.

4. **Batched Sending**: The service sends telemetry data in batches to reduce network overhead.

5. **Data Sanitization**: The service sanitizes sensitive information in telemetry data.

6. **Session and User Tracking**: The service includes session and user information in telemetry data for better analysis.

### TelemetryDashboardComponent

The `TelemetryDashboardComponent` provides a user interface for analyzing error and performance telemetry data. It includes the following features:

1. **Error Analysis**: The dashboard shows error distribution by type and over time, as well as a detailed list of recent errors.

2. **Performance Analysis**: The dashboard shows performance metrics by endpoint and over time, as well as a detailed list of endpoint performance.

3. **Filtering**: The dashboard allows filtering telemetry data by date range.

4. **Visualization**: The dashboard uses Chart.js to visualize telemetry data in various chart types.

5. **Detailed Information**: The dashboard provides detailed information about errors and performance metrics in tabular format.

## Usage

### Configuring the HttpErrorInterceptor

The `HttpErrorInterceptor` can be configured with the following options:

```typescript
const config: HttpErrorInterceptorConfig = {
  showNotifications: true,
  retryFailedRequests: true,
  maxRetryAttempts: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  redirectToLogin: true,
  logErrors: true,
  includeRequestDetails: true,
  trackErrors: true,
  trackPerformance: true,
};

// In a component or service
constructor(private httpErrorInterceptor: HttpErrorInterceptor) {
  this.httpErrorInterceptor.configure(config);
}
```

### Using the TelemetryService

The `TelemetryService` can be used directly to track custom errors or performance metrics:

```typescript
// Track a custom error
this.telemetryService
  .trackError({
    errorCode: 'custom_error',
    statusCode: 0,
    userMessage: 'A custom error occurred',
    technicalMessage: 'Technical details about the error',
    url: window.location.href,
    method: 'CUSTOM',
  })
  .subscribe();

// Track a custom performance metric
this.telemetryService
  .trackPerformance({
    url: '/api/custom',
    method: 'CUSTOM',
    duration: 500,
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### Using the TelemetryDashboardComponent

The `TelemetryDashboardComponent` can be added to an Angular route:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'admin/telemetry',
    component: TelemetryDashboardComponent,
  },
];
```

## Conclusion

The HTTP error handling implementation provides a comprehensive solution for handling HTTP errors, tracking telemetry data, and analyzing error and performance metrics. It follows best practices for error handling, telemetry tracking, and data visualization.

The implementation is modular and configurable, allowing for easy customization and extension. It provides a solid foundation for error handling and telemetry tracking in the Date Night App.
