## Introduction

Accessibility is a core principle of the DateNight.io application. We strive to ensure that all users, regardless of ability, can use our application effectively. These guidelines provide a framework for implementing accessible features.

## WCAG Compliance

The DateNight.io application aims to comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

### Perceivable

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and alternatives for multimedia
- Create content that can be presented in different ways
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### Operable

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that causes seizures
- Provide ways to help users navigate and find content

### Understandable

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### Robust

- Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

## Keyboard Navigation

Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard:

- All interactive elements should be focusable
- Focus order should follow a logical sequence
- Focus states should be clearly visible
- Keyboard shortcuts should be documented and consistent
- Avoid keyboard traps where focus cannot escape an element

### Focus Management

- Manage focus when opening and closing dialogs
- Return focus to the triggering element when closing a dialog
- Trap focus within modal dialogs
- Skip to content links should be provided for keyboard users

## Screen Readers

Ensure that all content is accessible to screen readers:

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure dynamic content changes are announced
- Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### ARIA Attributes

- Use `aria-label` for elements without visible text
- Use `aria-labelledby` to associate elements with their labels
- Use `aria-describedby` to provide additional descriptions
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content
- Use `aria-expanded` for expandable elements
- Use `aria-hidden` to hide decorative elements

## Color and Contrast

Ensure sufficient color contrast and avoid relying solely on color:

- Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (AA)
- Large text should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (AA)
- UI components and graphics should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
- Do not use color alone to convey information
- Provide additional indicators (icons, text, patterns)

## Forms and Inputs

Ensure that forms and inputs are accessible:

- All form controls should have associated labels
- Required fields should be clearly indicated
- Error messages should be clear and descriptive
- Form validation should provide clear feedback
- Group related form controls with fieldset and legend

## Images and Media

Ensure that images and media are accessible:

- All images should have appropriate alt text
- Decorative images should have empty alt text
- Complex images should have detailed descriptions
- Videos should have captions and audio descriptions
- Audio content should have transcripts

## Dynamic Content

Ensure that dynamic content is accessible:

- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Provide appropriate announcements for loading states
- Ensure that notifications are accessible to screen readers
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Testing

Regular accessibility testing is essential:

- Automated testing with tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
- Manual testing with keyboard navigation
- Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- User testing with people with disabilities

### Testing Checklist

- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Screen readers can access all content
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Forms and inputs are properly labeled
- Error messages are clear and accessible
- Dynamic content is properly announced
- Images and media have appropriate alternatives
