## Design Principles

The DateNight.io application follows these core design principles:

### User-Centered Design

- Design with the user's needs and goals in mind
- Conduct user research to inform design decisions
- Test designs with real users and iterate based on feedback

### Simplicity

- Keep interfaces simple and intuitive
- Reduce cognitive load by minimizing choices
- Use progressive disclosure for complex features

### Consistency

- Maintain consistent visual language across the application
- Use established patterns for common interactions
- Follow the design system guidelines for all components

### Accessibility

- Design for users of all abilities
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Test with assistive technologies

## Visual Hierarchy

Effective visual hierarchy helps users understand and navigate the interface:

### Typography Hierarchy

- Use heading levels (H1-H6) appropriately to establish content hierarchy
- Maintain consistent font sizes and weights for each heading level
- Use text styles from the design system for consistent typography

### Layout Hierarchy

- Place primary actions in prominent positions
- Group related elements together
- Use whitespace to create visual separation between sections
- Align elements to create a clean, organized layout

### Color Hierarchy

- Use primary colors for primary actions and important information
- Use secondary colors for secondary actions and supporting elements
- Use neutral colors for backgrounds and non-interactive elements
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text and interactive elements

## Consistency

Consistency creates a cohesive user experience:

### Visual Consistency

- Use design tokens for all visual properties
- Follow the BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Use components from the Emerald UI library

### Interaction Consistency

- Use consistent interaction patterns for similar actions
- Maintain consistent behavior for interactive elements
- Follow platform conventions for common interactions

### Language Consistency

- Use consistent terminology throughout the application
- Write clear, concise, and user-friendly text
- Follow the content style guide for tone and voice

## Feedback and Affordance

Provide clear feedback and affordance to guide users:

### Feedback

- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Use appropriate loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- Display clear error messages when something goes wrong
- Confirm successful actions with appropriate notifications

### Affordance

- Make interactive elements clearly identifiable
- Use appropriate cursor styles for different interactions
- Provide hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Use appropriate icons to communicate functionality

## Performance

Performance is a critical aspect of user experience:

### Loading Performance

- Optimize initial load time with lazy loading
- Use skeleton screens for content that's loading
- Prioritize loading critical content first

### Interaction Performance

- Ensure smooth animations and transitions
- Optimize for 60fps animations
- Debounce input events to prevent excessive processing

### Perceived Performance

- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
