## Current Status

| Phase   | Status      | Description                             |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | ‚úÖ Complete | Core design tokens and basic components |

- Applied animations and micro-interactions to Chat Room component
- Implemented dark mode support for key components
- Added accessibility improvements to interactive elements
- Optimized animations for mobile devices
- Added support for reduced motion preferences

## Known Issues

1. **Font Budget**: The Google Fonts import has been optimized, but still needs monitoring to ensure it stays within budget.
2. **CSS Variable Usage**: Some components may still be using hardcoded values instead of design tokens. Use the CSS variable checker utility to identify these issues.
3. **BEM Naming Convention**: Not all components follow the BEM naming convention. Use the BEM utilities to ensure consistent naming.
4. **Responsive Design**: Some components may not be fully responsive according to the breakpoints defined in the design system. Use the responsive utilities to ensure consistent behavior.
5. **Accessibility**: Some components may not meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Use the accessibility utilities to ensure compliance.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 4 (Complete)

- [x] Implement micro-interactions utilities
- [x] Add advanced animations utilities
- [x] Implement skeleton loaders
- [x] Apply micro-interactions to components
- [x] Apply animations to components
- [x] Implement performance optimizations

## Usage Guidelines

### Using Design Tokens

Always use design tokens instead of hardcoded values:

```scss
// ‚ùå Bad
.element {
  color: #ff6b93;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 1rem;
}

// ‚úÖ Good
.element {
  color: var(--color-primary);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
  padding: var(--spacing-4);
}
```

### Using BEM Naming Convention

Follow the BEM naming convention for all components:

```scss
// ‚ùå Bad
.card {
  // ...

  .title {
    // ...
  }

  .active {
    // ...
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Good
.card {
  // ...

  &__title {
    // ...
  }

  &--active {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Or use the BEM utilities:

```scss
@use 'path/to/bem-utilities' as bem;

.card {
  // ...

  @include bem.element('title') {
    // ...
  }

  @include bem.modifier('active') {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Using Responsive Utilities

Use the responsive utilities for consistent responsive behavior:

```scss
@use 'path/to/responsive-utilities' as responsive;

.element {
  // Base styles

  @include responsive.up('tablet') {
    // Tablet and up styles
  }

  @include responsive.down('desktop') {
    // Desktop and down styles
  }
}
```

### Using Accessibility Utilities

Use the accessibility utilities to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

```scss
@use 'path/to/accessibility-utilities' as a11y;

.element {
  // ...

  @include a11y.focus-visible;
}

.sr-only {
  @include a11y.visually-hidden;
}
```
