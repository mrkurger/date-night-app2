# Change Log

## 2025-04-16: Workflow Error Monitoring System

### New Features

- **Workflow Error Monitoring**: Added a new workflow (`sync-workflow-errors-fixed.yml`) that automatically collects logs from failed GitHub Actions workflows
- **Error Analysis Tool**: Created a script (`scripts/analyze-workflow-errors.js`) to analyze workflow error logs and generate reports with recommendations
- **Automated Reporting**: The system automatically identifies common error patterns and provides specific recommendations for fixing them

### Fixed

- **Workflow Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility issues with the Octokit library by removing the throttling plugin and using a more stable version of the REST API client

## 2025-04-16: Security Fixes and Workflow Improvements

### Security Fixes

#### High Severity

- **dawidd6/action-download-artifact**: Updated from v2 to v6 in `.github/workflows/sync-test-reports.yml` to fix artifact poisoning vulnerability (GHSA-5xr6-xhww-33m4)
- **semver**: Updated from ^7.7.1 to ^7.5.4 in both root and server package.json to fix Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability (GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw)

#### Medium Severity

- **vite**: Updated from ^6.2.6 to ^6.2.7 in all package.json files to fix server.fs.deny bypass vulnerabilities (GHSA-356w-63v5-8wf4, GHSA-xcj6-pq6g-qj4x)
- **got**: Added override for ^12.1.0 in root package.json to fix UNIX socket redirect vulnerability (GHSA-pfrx-2q88-qq97)

### Workflow Improvements

- **Angular Tests**: Added `--no-progress` flag to unit test command to improve CI output and potentially fix failing tests
- **GitHub Actions**: Added `CI=true` environment variable to all workflow jobs to fix husky installation issues
- **Package Scripts**: Updated `prepare` script in root package.json to skip husky installation in CI environments

### Known Issues

- **vite**: There are still moderate severity vulnerabilities in the nested vite dependency within @angular/build. This will require a future update of the Angular build tools to fully resolve.

## 2025-04-16: Angular Testing Improvements, Design System Fixes, and Documentation Updates

### Fixed

- Fixed variable naming conflict in wallet service test where `paymentMethods` was renamed to `paymentMethodsArray` to avoid conflict with array methods like `find()`.
- Fixed auth middleware test by properly mocking JWT verification and user lookup in the optionalAuth test.
- Fixed MongoDB driver warnings:
  - Removed deprecated options `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` from test setup
  - Fixed duplicate index in token-blacklist model by removing redundant `index: true` on fields with `unique: true`
  - Fixed duplicate index in wallet model by removing redundant `walletSchema.index({ userId: 1 }, { unique: true })` since `userId` already has `unique: true` in the schema definition
- Fixed auth service tests:
  - Added proper environment variables setup in the beforeEach block
  - Updated JWT verification expectations to use the actual refresh token secret
- Fixed wallet service tests:
  - Properly mocked the `id` method on the `paymentMethods` array to fix "is not a function" errors
