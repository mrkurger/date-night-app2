# Migration Documentation

## Progress Summary
- Migrated ad-browser feature to Angular (`AdBrowserComponent` and its template).
- Migrated ad-details feature to Angular (`AdDetailsComponent` and its template).
- Migrated chat functionality into Angular (`ChatComponent` and its template).
- Migrated authentication logic into an Angular injectable service (`AuthService`).
- Migrated profile management into Angular (`ProfileComponent` and its template).
- Migrated ads management into Angular with full implementations for listing, creating, detailing, and swipe view.

## Completed Tasks
- New Angular components have been created for ad-browser, ad-details, chat, profile, and ads (ad-list, ad-create, ad-detail, swipe-view).
- Routing has been updated via `AppRoutingModule` and module child routes to include the migrated features.
- Angular modules (Core, Shared, Features) have been restructured to integrate new components.
- Basic functionality for ad viewing, ad creation, chat messaging, user authentication, and profile updates is in place.
- Existing seed and setup scripts remain working for backend setup.

## Remaining Tasks
- Migrate additional legacy AngularJS features (e.g., ads auth-callback controllers) into Angular components/services.
- Write complete unit tests and integration tests for all migrated components and services.
- Replace all placeholder code regions with comprehensive implementations and robust error handling.
- Remove legacy AngularJS code, libraries, and dependencies once migration is complete.
- Enhance security with Angular HTTP interceptors, authentication guards, and updated error logging.
- Finalize production build configurations and optimize application performance (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting).

## Future Improvements
- Implement further UI/UX refinements and performance enhancements.
- Expand real-time features and connection stability in chat using improved socket handling.
- Update overall project documentation (README, Developer Guides) to reflect the new Angular structure.
