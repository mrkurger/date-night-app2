## System Architecture

The Date Night App uses a modern, microservices-based architecture with the following components:

- **Client**: Angular-based web application
- **API Server**: Node.js/Express.js REST API
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication
- **Media Service**: Handles image and file uploads
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with Stripe for payments
- **Notification Service**: Handles email and push notifications

## Component Hierarchy

The Angular client is organized into modules and components following Angular best practices:

- **App Component**: Root component
- **Navigation Component**: Main navigation
- **Router Outlet**: Dynamic content based on routes
- **Feature Modules**:
  - Auth Module: Login, Register, Forgot Password
  - Ads Module: Ad List, Ad Detail, Ad Form, Ad Search
  - Profile Module: User Profile, Edit Profile, User Ads
  - Chat Module: Conversation List, Message List, Message Form
  - Travel Module: Travel List, Travel Form, Travel Map
  - Payment Module: Payment Methods, Add Payment Method, Payment History

## Data Flow

The data flow in the Date Night App follows a standard client-server architecture:

1. User interacts with the UI
2. UI sends HTTP requests to the API server
3. API server processes requests and interacts with the database
4. API server returns HTTP responses to the UI
5. UI updates the display based on the responses

Additional data flows include:
- Event-based notifications via an event bus
- Payment processing via the payment service
- Media uploads and downloads via the media service

![Data Flow](/docs/images/data_flow.md)

## Database Schema

The Date Night App uses MongoDB as its primary database. The main collections are:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles
- **Advertisements**: Dating service advertisements
- **TravelLocations**: User travel itineraries
- **Conversations**: Chat conversations between users
- **Messages**: Individual chat messages
- **PaymentMethods**: User payment methods
- **Payments**: Payment records

![Database Schema](/docs/images/database_schema.md)

## API Endpoints

The Date Night App API is organized into the following groups:

- **Authentication**: Login, Register, Refresh Token, Logout
- **User Management**: Get Profile, Update Profile, Delete User
- **Advertisement Management**: Create Ad, Get Ads, Get Ad by ID, Update Ad, Delete Ad
- **Travel Itinerary**: Add Location, Get Locations, Update Location, Delete Location
- **Chat**: Get Conversations, Get Messages, Send Message
- **Media Management**: Upload Media, Delete Media
- **Payment**: Create Payment Intent, Get Payment Methods, Add Payment Method

## Technology Stack

The Date Night App uses the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular
- **State Management**: NgRx
- **UI Components**: Angular Material
- **CSS Preprocessor**: SCSS
- **HTTP Client**: Angular HttpClient
- **Testing**: Jasmine, Karma

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ODM**: Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest

### DevOps
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Deployment Architecture

The Date Night App can be deployed in various environments:

### Development
- Local development environment with hot reloading
- MongoDB running locally or in a Docker container
- Node.js API server running locally

### Staging
- Containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- MongoDB running in a container
- Node.js API server running in a container
- Angular client served from a static file server

### Production
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- MongoDB running in a managed service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- Node.js API server running in multiple pods
- Angular client served from a CDN
- Load balancer for API server
- Separate services for authentication, media, payment, and notifications

## Security Architecture

The Date Night App implements the following security measures:

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Token refresh mechanism
- CSRF protection

### Data Security
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- MongoDB security best practices
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Payment information stored securely with Stripe

### Infrastructure Security
- Firewall rules
- Network segmentation
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing

## Performance Considerations

The Date Night App is designed for optimal performance:

### Frontend
- Lazy loading of modules
- AOT compilation
- Minification and bundling
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies

### Backend
- Database indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Response caching
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancing
- Horizontal scaling
- Database sharding
- Caching layers

## Scalability Considerations

The Date Night App is designed to scale horizontally:

### Frontend
- Stateless design
- CDN distribution
- Progressive web app capabilities

### Backend
- Stateless API design
- Microservices architecture
- Message queues for asynchronous processing
- Database scaling strategies
- Caching strategies

### Infrastructure
- Auto-scaling groups
- Container orchestration
- Database replication
- Load balancing
- Geographic distribution
