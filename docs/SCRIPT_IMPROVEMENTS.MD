## Test Report Combiner

**File:** `/scripts/combine-test-reports.js`

### Original Issues

1. **Brittle HTML Parsing**: The script used regular expressions to parse HTML content, which is prone to breaking if the HTML structure changes.
2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Critical errors didn't cause the script to exit with a non-zero status code, potentially hiding failures.
3. **Limited Robustness**: The script didn't handle edge cases like missing files or directories well.

### Improvements Made

1. **More Robust Regex Patterns**:

   - Added word boundaries (`\b`) to improve pattern matching
   - Made patterns case-insensitive
   - Added more flexible whitespace handling

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:

   - Added proper error propagation with `process.exit(1)` for critical failures
   - Added try/catch blocks around file operations
   - Added return values to indicate success/failure

3. **Better Logging**:

   - Added more detailed log messages
   - Added warnings for missing metrics
   - Added clear success/failure messages

4. **Defensive Programming**:

   - Added checks for directory existence
   - Added fallback behavior for missing files
   - Generated minimal reports even when data is incomplete

5. **Code Documentation**:
   - Added JSDoc comments to all functions
   - Added detailed descriptions of parameters and return values
   - Added explanatory comments for complex logic

## Snyk Task List Generator

**File:** `/.github/scripts/generate-snyk-task-list.js`

### Original Issues

1. **Dependency on Snyk JSON Structure**: The script relied on specific structure of Snyk's JSON output without defensive checks.
2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The main execution flow didn't have overarching error handling.
3. **Limited Defensive Coding**: The script didn't use optional chaining or nullish coalescing for nested properties.

### Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced JSON Parsing**:

   - Added separate try/catch blocks for JSON parsing
   - Added validation of parsed data structure
   - Added fallbacks for missing or invalid data

2. **Defensive Property Access**:

   - Added optional chaining (`?.`) for all nested property access
   - Added nullish coalescing (`??`) and default values
   - Added type checking before operations (e.g., `Array.isArray()`)

3. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Added proper error propagation with `process.exit(1)`
   - Added try/catch blocks around file operations and report generation
   - Added return values to indicate success/failure

4. **Better Logging**:

   - Added more detailed log messages
   - Added warnings for missing files or data
   - Added clear success/failure messages

5. **Code Documentation**:
   - Added JSDoc comments to all functions
   - Added detailed descriptions of parameters and return values
   - Added explanatory comments for complex logic
   - Added input/output file documentation

## General Improvements

1. **Consistent Return Values**:

   - Functions now return boolean values to indicate success/failure
   - This allows for better error handling and flow control

2. **Directory Creation**:

   - Added checks for directory existence
   - Added proper error handling for directory creation
   - Used `{ recursive: true }` for safer directory creation

3. **File Writing**:

   - Added try/catch blocks around file writing operations
   - Added proper error handling for file writing failures

4. **Process Exit Codes**:
   - Added `process.exit(1)` for critical failures
   - This ensures that CI/CD pipelines will fail when scripts fail

## Best Practices

The following best practices were applied to both scripts:

1. **Defensive Programming**:

   - Always check if files exist before reading them
   - Always validate JSON data after parsing
   - Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing for nested properties
   - Check array types before using array methods

2. **Error Handling**:

   - Use try/catch blocks around I/O operations
   - Propagate errors up the call stack
   - Exit with non-zero status codes for critical failures
   - Provide meaningful error messages

3. **Logging**:

   - Log the start and end of major operations
   - Log warnings for non-critical issues
   - Log errors with context information
   - Provide clear success/failure messages

4. **Code Documentation**:
   - Use JSDoc comments for functions
   - Document parameters and return values
   - Explain complex logic with inline comments
   - Document the purpose and usage of the script

These improvements make the scripts more robust, easier to maintain, and more reliable in CI/CD environments.
