- **Issue Updates**: Check the automatically created/updated issues

## Technical Improvements (v2.0)

### Recent Enhancements
1. **Fixed deprecated syntax**: Replaced `::set-output` with modern `GITHUB_OUTPUT`
2. **Improved error handling**: Better handling of edge cases and division by zero
3. **Enhanced Trivy workflow**: Continues on failures and generates artifacts
4. **Added concurrency control**: Prevents multiple dashboard generations
5. **Added timeouts**: 15-minute timeout for dashboard generation
6. **Enhanced content**: More comprehensive recommendations and information

### Security Features
- Minimal required permissions (contents: read, actions: read, issues: write)
- Secure artifact handling with retention policies
- No secrets required for basic functionality
- Compatible with private repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No recent scans showing**: Ensure Trivy and CodeQL workflows are enabled and running
2. **Dashboard not updating**: Check workflow triggers and permissions
3. **Missing artifacts**: Verify artifact retention settings and workflow completion

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ for dashboard generation
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Proper workflow permissions configured

## Configuration

### Customizing Scan Frequency
Edit the cron schedule in `trivy-codeql-dashboard.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily at 6 AM UTC
```

### Modifying Security Tools
- Add/remove workflow names in the `workflow_run.workflows` array
- Customize severity levels in Trivy scans
- Adjust CodeQL query sets

### Dashboard Customization
- Modify the HTML template in the dashboard generation script
- Adjust metrics calculations
- Add custom recommendations
