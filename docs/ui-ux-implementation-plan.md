### UI Weaknesses

1. **Inconsistent Styling Patterns**: Some components define styles locally rather than using design system variables
2. **Potential Accessibility Issues**: Limited evidence of comprehensive accessibility implementation
3. **Complex Components**: Some components are large and difficult to maintain
4. **Limited Animation Guidelines**: No clear standards for animations and transitions
5. **Incomplete BEM Implementation**: Inconsistent naming conventions
6. **Inconsistent Component API**: Varying patterns for inputs, outputs, and methods
7. **Incomplete Responsive Design**: Some components don't fully adapt to all screen sizes
8. **Inconsistent Loading States**: Loading states implemented differently across the application

### UX Weaknesses

1. **Incomplete Chat Features**: Missing typing indicators, read receipts, and media sharing
2. **Limited Feedback on Actions**: Some user actions lack immediate feedback
3. **Complex Error Dashboard**: Error information may be overwhelming for users
4. **Unclear Onboarding Process**: No clear evidence of user onboarding or guidance
5. **Potential Performance Issues**: Large components may impact performance
