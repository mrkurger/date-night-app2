## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-factor Authentication

- Support for email verification during registration
- Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive operations
- OAuth integration with major providers (Google, GitHub, Reddit, Apple)

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using Argon2id with appropriate parameters
- Legacy passwords use bcrypt (for backward compatibility)
- Password strength requirements enforced (minimum length, complexity)
- Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

### Session Management

- JWT-based authentication with appropriate expiration
- Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
- CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- Sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Database-level encryption for PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- TLS/SSL for all data in transit
- End-to-end encryption for chat messages

### Data Minimization

- Collection of only necessary user information
- Clear data retention policies
- User data deletion capabilities
- Anonymization of data used for analytics

## End-to-End Encryption

### Chat Encryption

- Messages encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Key exchange using RSA-2048
- Perfect forward secrecy through key rotation
- Encrypted file attachments

### Key Management

- Client-side key generation
- Private keys never transmitted to the server
- Secure key storage in browser using protected localStorage
- Key verification capabilities

### Implementation Details

For detailed information about the end-to-end encryption implementation, see [END_TO_END_ENCRYPTION.md](END_TO_END_ENCRYPTION.md).

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- Tiered rate limiting based on endpoint sensitivity
- More restrictive limits for authentication endpoints
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Exponential backoff for repeated failures

### Input Validation

- Comprehensive validation for all API inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Content-type validation
- File upload restrictions and scanning

### Output Encoding

- Proper encoding of all user-generated content
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- X-Content-Type-Options and other security headers
- Sanitization of HTML content

## Frontend Security

### XSS Prevention

- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Angular's built-in sanitization
- Strict contextual escaping
- Use of trusted types where supported

### Client-side Validation

- Comprehensive form validation
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Protection against common client-side attacks
- Secure local storage practices

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- Network segmentation
- Regular security scans

### Server Hardening

- Regular security updates
- Minimal required services running
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Secure configuration baselines

### Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging with encryption
- Anomaly detection
- Real-time security alerts
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency scanning
- Container scanning

### Manual Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Code reviews with security focus
- Threat modeling
- Bug bounty program

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- Documented incident response plan
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Communication templates
- Regular drills and simulations

### Detection and Analysis

- Monitoring systems for early detection
- Log analysis procedures
- Forensic capabilities
- Severity classification guidelines

### Containment and Eradication

- Procedures for isolating affected systems
- Malware removal processes
- Vulnerability patching
- Service restoration priorities

### Post-Incident Activities

- Root cause analysis
- Documentation of lessons learned
- Process improvements
- Disclosure procedures

## Compliance

- GDPR compliance for European users
- CCPA compliance for California residents
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- Data processing agreements with third parties
