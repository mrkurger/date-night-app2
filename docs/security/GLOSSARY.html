        <h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
        
        <dl>
          <dt id="trivy">Trivy</dt>
          <dd>
            A comprehensive, open-source security scanner for containers, file systems, and git repositories.
            Trivy detects vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="sbom">SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)</dt>
          <dd>
            A formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies, their relationships, 
            and hierarchical structure, used to track and manage security vulnerabilities.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="cve">CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</dt>
          <dd>
            A standardized identifier for known security vulnerabilities, maintained by MITRE Corporation.
            Each CVE entry includes identification number, description, and references.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="sast">SAST (Static Application Security Testing)</dt>
          <dd>
            A testing methodology that analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the program.
            Trivy performs SAST when scanning repositories.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="severity">Severity Level</dt>
          <dd>
            A classification of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability.
            Common levels include CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="secret-scanning">Secret Scanning</dt>
          <dd>
            The process of detecting credentials, API keys, tokens, and other sensitive information in source code,
            which should not be committed to repositories.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="dependency-scanning">Dependency Scanning</dt>
          <dd>
            The process of checking software dependencies (libraries, packages, etc.) for known security vulnerabilities.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="exit-code">Exit Code</dt>
          <dd>
            A value returned by a process to indicate its completion status. In security scanning,
            non-zero exit codes typically indicate that vulnerabilities were found.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="sarif">SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)</dt>
          <dd>
            A JSON-based standard format for the output of static analysis tools, enabling integration
            with different development and security tools.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Workflow Components</h2>
        
        <dl>
          <dt id="trivy-config">trivy.yaml</dt>
          <dd>
            Configuration file for Trivy scanner that defines scanning parameters, severity thresholds,
            and output formats.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="trivy-scan-workflow">trivy-scan.yml</dt>
          <dd>
            GitHub Actions workflow file that defines the security scanning process, including
            when scans run, what they scan for, and how results are processed.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="workflow-dispatch">workflow_dispatch</dt>
          <dd>
            A GitHub Actions trigger that allows workflows to be manually executed from the GitHub interface,
            useful for running on-demand security scans.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="concurrency-control">Concurrency Control</dt>
          <dd>
            A mechanism in GitHub Actions that prevents multiple instances of the same workflow
            from running simultaneously, optimizing resource usage.
          </dd>
          
          <dt id="submodule-initialization">Submodule Initialization</dt>
          <dd>
            The process of initializing and updating Git submodules, which are Git repositories
            nested within another Git repository, ensuring they are also scanned for vulnerabilities.
