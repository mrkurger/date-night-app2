      <section>
        <h2>Implementation Insights</h2>
        <p>
          During the implementation of security scanning workflows in the Date Night App,
          we learned several key lessons about effective security automation:
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Balance Between Strictness and Practicality</h3>
        <p>
          Initially, the Trivy workflow was configured to fail builds on any vulnerability
          detection. This proved impractical as many dependencies contain known issues that
          cannot be immediately resolved. We learned to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <code>continue-on-error</code> for initial scans</li>
          <li>Set severity thresholds appropriately (focus on CRITICAL and HIGH)</li>
          <li>Generate comprehensive reports rather than simply failing builds</li>
          <li>Create actionable outputs that help developers resolve issues</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Configuration as Code</h3>
        <p>
          Moving the Trivy configuration to a dedicated <code>trivy.yaml</code> file rather than
          embedding all settings in the workflow provided several advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier maintenance and version control</li>
          <li>Better documentation of scanning parameters</li>
          <li>Ability to run the same configuration locally</li>
          <li>Simplified workflow file with less duplication</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Multi-Format Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          Generating multiple output formats (text, JSON, HTML) enabled different use cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML for human-readable comprehensive reports</li>
          <li>JSON for programmatic processing and integration with other tools</li>
          <li>Text for workflow logs and quick reference</li>
          <li>Markdown for GitHub workflow summaries</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Dependency Management</h2>
        <p>
          Security scanning tools themselves require careful dependency management:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tool Installation:</strong> We switched from manually installing Trivy via apt
            to using the official Trivy GitHub Action, which ensures compatibility and reduces
            maintenance overhead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database Updates:</strong> Security scanners depend on vulnerability databases
            that need regular updates. We learned to explicitly manage database updates in the
            workflow to ensure current vulnerability detection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tool Versioning:</strong> Pinning to specific versions of security tools helps
            ensure consistent results, while occasionally updating to newer versions brings
            improved detection capabilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Testing security scanning workflows required specialized approaches:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Deliberate Vulnerability Testing:</strong> Creating temporary test files with
            known vulnerabilities helped verify that the scanner was working correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>False Positive Handling:</strong> Developing strategies to identify and suppress
            false positives while still catching real issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Verifying that scanning results properly integrate
            with other GitHub features like code scanning alerts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          Security scanning can be resource-intensive. We implemented several optimizations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Targeted Scanning:</strong> Focusing scans on relevant directories and file types
            rather than scanning everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Caching:</strong> Enabling Trivy's cache to speed up repeat scans and reduce
            database download frequency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parallelization:</strong> Running different types of scans (code, secrets, dependencies)
            as separate steps rather than one monolithic scan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimized Triggers:</strong> Running comprehensive scans on schedule rather than
            on every commit to balance security and performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
