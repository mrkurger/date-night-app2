Workflow Error Analysis

1. angular-tests Workflow (Based on Provided Logs)

Observed Failure Points:
test (22.x) job: Fails during the Run unit tests step (npm test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless --no-progress).
e2e (22.x) job: Fails during the Run Cypress tests step, specifically within the prerequisite build command (npm run build).
Root Cause: The failures consistently stem from code compilation errors within the client-angular project, not fundamental issues with the GitHub Actions workflow steps themselves. The workflows correctly execute npm run build or ng test, but these commands fail due to invalid code.
Common Specific Errors (Recurring across multiple runs):
SCSS Deprecations & Errors:
Widespread use of deprecated @import (should use @use/@forward).
Use of deprecated functions darken(), lighten().
Use of / for division outside calc() or math.div().
Errors: Undefined variables (e.g., $success-100, $neutral-50, $error-100, $primary), Conflicting variable definitions due to @forward issues (e.g., $primary-100), inability to find stylesheets for import (e.g., styles/scss/variables, styles/scss/mixins).
TypeScript/Angular Compiler Errors:
NG8002: Can't bind to '...' since it isn't a known property of '...': Numerous instances, especially with emerald-* components (emerald-skeleton-loader[layout], emerald-toggle[value], emerald-app-card properties like subtitle, description, imageUrl, avatarUrl, tags, itemId, actions). This strongly suggests issues with how these components (potentially standalone) are imported or used in templates.
TS2307: Cannot find module 'angularx-qrcode': Dependency is missing, incorrectly referenced, or incompatible. Also seen for internal paths like ./features/tinder/tinder.module and ../../shared/layouts/main-layout/main-layout.component.
TS-996008: Component ... is standalone, and cannot be declared in an NgModule: Incorrect NgModule configuration. Standalone components (LoginComponent, RegisterComponent, CardGridComponent, FloatingActionButtonComponent) should be in imports, not declarations.
TS-996004: Can't be exported from this NgModule, as it must be imported first: Related to the standalone/NgModule issue. Components must be imported before being exported by a module.
TS2393: Duplicate function implementation: Code duplication within app-card.component.ts (getMediaCount, formatPrice, getTruncatedDescription).
TS2339: Property '...' does not exist on type '...': Type mismatches (e.g., isAdvertiserOnline, advertiserImage, advertiserName, isVerified on Ad type; website on UserProfile). Indicates outdated or incorrect interfaces/models.
NG5: Argument of type 'Event' is not assignable...: Type mismatch in event handlers (e.g., (keyup.enter) providing Event instead of KeyboardEvent).
NG5002: Unclosed block / Invalid ICU message / Unexpected character "EOF": Template syntax errors.
TS1005, TS1141, TS1128, TS1434, TS2304: Various TypeScript syntax errors in profile.component.ts suggesting incomplete or broken code.
Karma Test Failures:
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'root') related to @angular/router: Often indicates problems setting up the router testing module, possibly due to the compilation errors.
Specific assertion failures (Expected 0 to be 1, Expected 'id19' to be 'id10', Expected null to be undefined): Indicate test logic errors or unexpected component states, likely influenced by compilation issues.
HttpClientTestingBackend.expectOne(...) found none/multiple requests: Errors in mocking HTTP requests within tests.
Error: NG0304: 'mat-card' is not a known element: Missing Angular Material module imports in test setups.
Error: You do not have permission... / Error: Failed to moderate media: Unhandled errors or incorrect mocking in tests involving error scenarios.
2. Other Workflows (Potential Failure Points based on Definitions)

security-alerts-report.yml:
Failure during npm install -g if global permissions are insufficient or packages conflict.
npm-check or npm audit commands failing (e.g., network issues, registry problems, severe vulnerabilities configured to cause failure).
npm-audit-html failing if npm audit output is unexpected.
Shell script errors (e.g., cd into non-existent directories, cat/cp failing on missing files).
git commit/push errors (permissions, conflicts - though [skip ci] helps avoid loops).
server-tests.yml:
npm ci failures (network, lockfile issues).
MongoDB service failing to start.
Unit/Integration test failures (npm test, npm run test:integration) due to code errors, incorrect test logic, or DB connection issues (MONGODB_URI env var).
ESLint failures (npx eslint .).
sync-github-insights.yml:
npm install @octokit/rest failure.
GitHub API errors within the actions/github-script step (authentication/permission issues with WORKFLOW_TOKEN, rate limiting, invalid API calls).
Node.js script errors (logic errors in report generation, file system errors).
git operations failing (stash conflicts, rebase conflicts, push permissions/conflicts).
sync-snyk-issues.yml:
npm install failures (root, server, client-angular).
snyk auth failure (invalid SNYK_TOKEN).
snyk test failures (scan errors, configuration issues, exceeding plan limits).
npm ls failures (less likely, but possible with corrupted node_modules).
generate-snyk-task-list.js script errors (reading/parsing JSON, file system errors, logic errors).
File operations (gzip, find, rm) failing (permissions, unexpected file states).
git commit/push errors.
sync-test-reports.yml:
Artifact download failures (dawidd6/action-download-artifact) if upstream workflows didn't run, failed, or didn't produce the artifact.
combine-test-reports.js script errors (if it exists and has bugs).
git operations failing, especially merge-tree or pull --rebase if conflicts are complex. gh pr create could fail due to permissions or API issues.
sync-workflow-errors.yml:
npm install failures.
fetch-workflow-logs.js script errors: GitHub API calls (auth, rate limits, permissions to read actions/logs), file system errors (creating directories, writing files), adm-zip errors if log archives are corrupted.
git operations failing (stash, rebase, push).
Common Error Themes Across Workflows (Observed & Potential)

Code Quality & Correctness (Dominant in angular-tests): The sheer number and variety of TS/Angular/SCSS errors in client-angular is the most significant issue based on the logs. This impacts builds and tests directly. Linting errors in server-tests (previously suppressed) also fall here.
Dependency Issues: Missing/incompatible modules (angularx-qrcode), potential npm ci failures, Snyk scan failures.
Testing Flakiness/Errors: Unit/Integration/E2E tests failing due to code errors, incorrect mocking, or actual test logic flaws.
Workflow Scripting Errors: Potential for Node.js scripts (generate-snyk-task-list.js, fetch-workflow-logs.js, etc.) or shell commands to fail due to logic errors, missing files, or unexpected states.
API Interaction Failures: Potential errors in workflows interacting with GitHub API, Snyk API (authentication, rate limits, permissions).
Git Operations: Potential failures during git pull/push/commit/stash/rebase, especially in report-syncing workflows dealing with potential conflicts.
Suggestions for Resolution and Improvement

A. Codebase (client-angular primarily, but applies broadly):

Fix All Compilation Errors: This is critical. Systematically go through the errors reported in the build/test logs and fix them.
Emerald Components: Ensure EmeraldModule (or individual components if standalone) is correctly imported where needed. Verify @Input() names match template bindings ([layout], [value], [subtitle], etc.). Check component documentation/source for correct usage.
Standalone Migration: Review all components flagged with TS-996008 or TS-996004. Ensure standalone components are in imports arrays of NgModules or other standalone components, not declarations. Ensure components intended for export are correctly imported and exported by their module.
Module Resolution: Fix TS2307 errors. Install missing dependencies (npm install angularx-qrcode). Correct relative paths for internal imports. Ensure tsconfig.json paths are correct.
Type Safety: Fix TS2339 errors by updating interfaces (Ad, UserProfile) or correcting property access in components. Fix NG5 event type mismatches.
Code Quality: Remove duplicate functions (TS2393). Fix syntax errors (TS1005, etc.).
Template Syntax: Fix NG5002 errors (unclosed blocks, invalid ICU, etc.).
Address SCSS Deprecations: Migrate from @import to @use/@forward. Replace deprecated functions. Fix SCSS errors (undefined variables, import paths).
Fix Failing Tests:
Ensure Angular Material modules (MatCardModule, etc.) are imported in TestBed setups where needed.
Correct assertion logic (Expected 0 to be 1, etc.).
Fix HTTP mocking issues (HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController). Ensure expectOne matches the actual request URL/method. Handle verify() correctly.
Address TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'root') by ensuring RouterTestingModule is correctly configured in tests needing routing.
Dependency Audit: Run npm audit fix (cautiously) and review Snyk/Dependabot alerts regularly. Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date.
B. Workflows & Scripts:

Error Handling in Scripts: Add robust error handling (try...catch, checking command exit codes) to all custom Node.js and shell scripts used in workflows. Log meaningful error messages.
API Resilience: For workflows using APIs (GitHub, Snyk):
Implement retries for transient network errors.
Handle rate limiting gracefully (e.g., wait and retry, or reduce request frequency).
Check for specific error statuses (e.g., 401/403 for auth, 404 for not found) and provide clear log messages.
Git Operations:
Conflict Handling: The PR creation strategy in sync-test-reports is good. Apply similar robust strategies (or fail gracefully with clear logs) to all workflows that commit reports (sync-github-insights, sync-snyk-issues, security-alerts-report, sync-workflow-errors).
Fetch Before Push: Always git fetch and git pull --rebase (or merge) before attempting to git push in report-syncing workflows to minimize simple conflicts.
Workflow Step Robustness:
Use if: always() judiciously for cleanup or reporting steps that need to run even if previous steps fail (like artifact uploads).
Ensure paths used in steps (working-directory, artifact path) are correct relative to the checkout root.
For artifact downloads (dawidd6/action-download-artifact), check the output/success status if subsequent steps depend on the artifact existing.
Resource Limits: While 8GB (--max_old_space_size=8192) is often sufficient for Angular builds, monitor if memory issues persist. Consider if specific jobs (like E2E with build) need more memory than others. Use workflow-level or job-level env vars for NODE_OPTIONS if needed.
Simplify sync-snyk-issues:
Consider if generating and committing full npm ls output (even gzipped) is necessary. It can significantly bloat the repository. The generate-snyk-task-list.js script primarily uses the Snyk JSON results. If npm ls is only for context, perhaps it can be generated only on demand or skipped.
The --depth=2 helps, but these files can still be large. Re-evaluate their necessity vs. repo size.
Conclusion:

The most immediate and impactful action is to fix the numerous code errors in client-angular. These errors are the direct cause of the failures observed in the angular-tests workflow logs and likely affect development productivity and application stability. Once the codebase compiles and tests pass reliably, focus can shift to making the report-syncing and other workflows more resilient to API issues and Git conflicts.
