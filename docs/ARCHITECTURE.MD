## Component Hierarchy

The Angular client is organized into modules and components following Angular best practices:

- **App Component**: Root component
- **Navigation Component**: Main navigation
- **Router Outlet**: Dynamic content based on routes
- **Feature Modules**:
  - Auth Module: Login, Register, Forgot Password
  - Ads Module: Ad List, Ad Detail, Ad Form, Ad Search
  - Profile Module: User Profile, Edit Profile, User Ads
  - Chat Module: Conversation List, Message List, Message Form
  - Travel Module: Travel List, Travel Form, Travel Map
  - Payment Module: Payment Methods, Add Payment Method, Payment History

## Data Flow

The data flow in the Date Night App follows a standard client-server architecture:

1. User interacts with the UI
2. UI sends HTTP requests to the API server
3. API server processes requests and interacts with the database
4. API server returns HTTP responses to the UI
5. UI updates the display based on the responses

Additional data flows include:

- Event-based notifications via an event bus
- Payment processing via the payment service
- Media uploads and downloads via the media service

## Database Schema

The Date Night App uses MongoDB as its primary database. The main collections are:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles
- **Advertisements**: Dating service advertisements
- **TravelLocations**: User travel itineraries
- **Conversations**: Chat conversations between users
- **Messages**: Individual chat messages
- **PaymentMethods**: User payment methods
- **Payments**: Payment records

![Database Schema](/docs/images/DATABASE_SCHEMA.MD)

## API Endpoints

The Date Night App API is organized into the following groups:

- **Authentication**: Login, Register, Refresh Token, Logout
- **User Management**: Get Profile, Update Profile, Delete User
- **Advertisement Management**: Create Ad, Get Ads, Get Ad by ID, Update Ad, Delete Ad
- **Travel Itinerary**: Add Location, Get Locations, Update Location, Delete Location
- **Chat**: Get Conversations, Get Messages, Send Message
- **Media Management**: Upload Media, Delete Media
- **Payment**: Create Payment Intent, Get Payment Methods, Add Payment Method

## Design Patterns

The Date Night App implements several design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and code quality:

### Frontend Patterns

1. **Component-Based Architecture**

   - Reusable UI components with clear interfaces
   - Smart/Container and Presentational/Dumb component separation
   - Component composition for complex UIs

2. **Reactive Programming**

   - Observable-based data flow with RxJS
   - Reactive forms for user input
   - State management with NgRx (Store, Effects, Selectors)

3. **Dependency Injection**

   - Service-based architecture
   - Hierarchical injector system
   - Testing facilitation through DI

4. **Module Organization**
   - Feature modules for domain-specific functionality
   - Shared module for common components
   - Core module for singleton services

### Backend Patterns

1. **MVC Architecture**

   - Controllers for handling HTTP requests
   - Services for business logic
   - Models for data representation

2. **Repository Pattern**

   - Data access abstraction
   - Query encapsulation
   - Database independence

3. **Middleware Pattern**

   - Request processing pipeline
   - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, error handling)
   - Request/response transformation

4. **Factory Pattern**
   - Object creation abstraction
   - Configuration-based instantiation
   - Testing facilitation

### Cross-Cutting Patterns

1. **Observer Pattern**

   - Event-based communication
   - Loose coupling between components
   - Real-time updates with Socket.IO

2. **Strategy Pattern**

   - Pluggable algorithms
   - Runtime behavior selection
   - Configuration-based behavior

3. **Adapter Pattern**

   - Third-party service integration
   - API normalization
   - Legacy code integration

4. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Dynamic behavior extension
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Non-invasive feature addition

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

The authentication system uses JWT tokens with a refresh token mechanism:

1. User logs in with credentials
2. Server validates credentials and issues access and refresh tokens
3. Client stores tokens securely
4. Access token is used for API requests
5. When access token expires, refresh token is used to obtain a new access token
6. Refresh tokens can be revoked for security

### Real-Time Communication

The chat system uses Socket.IO for real-time communication:

1. Client establishes Socket.IO connection
2. Connection is authenticated using JWT
3. Client joins rooms for conversations
4. Messages are sent and received in real-time
5. Offline messages are stored and delivered when user comes online
6. End-to-end encryption ensures message privacy

### Data Flow Optimization

The application optimizes data flow for performance:

1. Pagination for large data sets
2. Lazy loading of data and components
3. Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
4. Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
5. Debouncing and throttling for user input
6. Batch processing for multiple operations
