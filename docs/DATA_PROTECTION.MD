## Data Classification

We classify data into the following categories to determine appropriate protection measures:

### Highly Sensitive Data

- Authentication credentials (passwords, 2FA secrets)
- Private encryption keys
- Payment information
- Government-issued IDs and verification documents

### Sensitive Personal Data

- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Physical address
- Date of birth
- Profile photos
- Chat messages

### General Data

- Public profile information
- Ad listings (public)
- Reviews and ratings
- Location data (county/city level)

## Encryption Strategy

### Data at Rest

- **Database-level encryption**: MongoDB encrypted storage engine
- **Field-level encryption**: Sensitive fields are encrypted using AES-256
- **File encryption**: Uploaded files are encrypted with unique keys

### Data in Transit

- **TLS/SSL**: All API communications use TLS 1.3
- **Certificate pinning**: Mobile apps implement certificate pinning
- **Secure WebSockets**: Real-time communications use WSS protocol

### End-to-End Encryption

- **Chat messages**: Encrypted using AES-256-GCM with RSA key exchange
- **File attachments**: Encrypted before upload
- **Key management**: Keys generated and stored client-side only

For detailed information about the end-to-end encryption implementation, see [END_TO_END_ENCRYPTION.MD](END_TO_END_ENCRYPTION.md).

## Data Storage

### Database Security

- **Access controls**: Strict database user permissions
- **Network isolation**: Databases in private subnets
- **Audit logging**: All database access is logged
- **Backup encryption**: All backups are encrypted

### File Storage

- **Encrypted storage**: All files stored with server-side encryption
- **Access controls**: Time-limited signed URLs for access
- **Metadata separation**: File metadata stored separately from content
- **CDN security**: Appropriate security headers and access controls

### Local Storage (Client-side)

- **Sensitive data**: Minimal sensitive data stored locally
- **Encryption**: Local data encrypted when possible
- **Session data**: Cleared on logout
- **Cache control**: Appropriate cache headers to prevent sensitive data caching

## Access Controls

### Authentication

- **Multi-factor authentication**: Available for all accounts
- **Session management**: Secure session handling with appropriate timeouts
- **OAuth security**: Secure implementation of OAuth providers

### Authorization

- **Role-based access control**: Granular permissions system
- **Principle of least privilege**: Users only have access to necessary data
- **Resource ownership**: Clear ownership model for all resources
- **API authorization**: Token-based access with appropriate scopes

### Administrative Access

- **Just-in-time access**: Temporary elevated privileges
- **Audit logging**: All administrative actions logged
- **Separation of duties**: Critical operations require multiple approvers
- **Access reviews**: Regular review of access permissions

## Data Lifecycle Management

### Data Collection

- **Minimization**: Only collecting necessary data
- **Consent**: Clear consent for all data collection
- **Transparency**: Clear privacy policy and data usage information

### Data Retention

- **Retention periods**: Defined retention periods for different data types
- **Automatic deletion**: Expired data automatically deleted
- **Archiving**: Secure archiving for data with longer retention requirements
- **Legal holds**: Process for implementing legal holds when required

### Data Deletion

- **User-initiated deletion**: Users can delete their data
- **Secure deletion**: Multi-pass deletion for sensitive data
- **Verification**: Verification process to confirm deletion
- **Third-party deletion**: Process for ensuring deletion from third-party services

## User Rights and Controls

### Transparency

- **Privacy policy**: Comprehensive privacy policy
- **Data usage**: Clear information about how data is used
- **Third parties**: Disclosure of third-party data sharing

### User Controls

- **Privacy settings**: Granular privacy controls
- **Data export**: Ability to export personal data
- **Data deletion**: Option to delete account and data
- **Communication preferences**: Control over notifications and communications

### Consent Management

- **Explicit consent**: Clear consent for data processing
- **Consent withdrawal**: Easy process to withdraw consent
- **Consent records**: Maintaining records of consent
- **Age verification**: Ensuring appropriate age for consent

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- **Legal basis**: Identified legal basis for all processing
- **Data subject rights**: Processes for handling rights requests
- **Impact assessments**: Data protection impact assessments
- **Breach notification**: Process for timely breach notification

### CCPA Compliance

- **Disclosure requirements**: Clear disclosure of data practices
- **Opt-out rights**: Process for opting out of data sales
- **Access requests**: Handling consumer access requests
- **Non-discrimination**: Equal service regardless of privacy choices

### Industry Standards

- **PCI DSS**: Compliance for payment processing
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST frameworks**: Following NIST cybersecurity framework
- **Regular audits**: Third-party security audits
