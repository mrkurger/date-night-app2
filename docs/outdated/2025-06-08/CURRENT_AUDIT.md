## Next Steps

1. Review unmapped documentation files and determine appropriate code folders
2. Create HTML templates for CHANGELOG.html, AILESSONS.html, and GLOSSARY.html
3. Convert Markdown to HTML using established templates
4. Move documentation to appropriate code folders
5. Update internal links to point to new locations
