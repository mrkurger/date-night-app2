# Linting Issues and Fixes

## Overview

This document tracks the linting issues in the codebase and the fixes that have been applied.

## Server Issues

### Fixed Issues

1. **Unreachable Code in Tests**
   - File: `/server/tests/unit/services/ad.service.test.js`
   - Issue: Unreachable code after `return` statements in test cases
   - Fix: Commented out the unreachable code for future implementation

## Client-Angular Issues

### Fixed Issues

1. **Unused Variables**

   - Fixed unused variables in various files by either:
     - Prefixing with underscore (e.g., `_variable`) to indicate intentional non-use
     - Commenting out unused imports and variables
     - Removing unused variables

2. **Catch Clause Variables**
   - Fixed catch clause variables that were defined but not used by either:
     - Removing the variable name (using just `catch {}`)
     - Prefixing with underscore (e.g., `catch (_error) {}`)

### Remaining Warnings

1. **TypeScript `any` Type Usage**

   - There are approximately 570 warnings related to the use of `any` type
   - The `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule is currently disabled in the ESLint configuration
   - A systematic approach to replacing `any` types with more specific types should be implemented in the future

2. **Unused Variables in Test Files**
   - Some test files still have unused variables
   - These are not critical and can be addressed in future updates

## Recommendations

1. **Type Safety Improvements**

   - Create interfaces or type definitions for commonly used data structures
   - Gradually replace `any` types with more specific types
   - Consider enabling the `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule with exceptions where necessary

2. **Test Code Cleanup**

   - Review and clean up test files to remove or properly use all declared variables
   - Consider using a more strict ESLint configuration for test files

3. **Regular Linting**
   - Run `npm run lint` regularly during development to catch issues early
   - Consider adding a pre-commit hook to run linting before commits

## Changelog

- **2024-05-01**: Fixed server-side linting errors related to unreachable code
- **2024-05-01**: Fixed client-side linting warnings related to unused variables
