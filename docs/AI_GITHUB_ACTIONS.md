## Implementation Plan

To implement these AI-powered GitHub Actions:

1. **Start with the basics**:

   - CodeQL Analysis for security
   - GitHub Copilot for PRs for code review

2. **Add performance monitoring**:

   - Lighthouse CI for web performance

3. **Enhance documentation**:

   - AI Documentation Generator
   - AI Changelog Generator

4. **Improve testing**:
   - Test Insights with AI

Each of these actions can be implemented incrementally to avoid overwhelming the CI/CD pipeline and to allow time for the team to adapt to the new tools and insights.
