# GitHub Insights

This directory contains reports and data generated from GitHub Actions workflows that provide insights into the project's health, security, and development activity.

## Available Reports

- `insights-report.md`: A comprehensive report of repository activity, workflow runs, security alerts, and more
- `ai-analysis-data.md`: Structured data specifically formatted for AI analysis

## How to Update These Reports

These reports are automatically generated by the `sync-github-insights.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, which runs:

- On a daily schedule (midnight UTC)
- When manually triggered from the GitHub Actions UI

To get the latest reports locally:

1. Run the sync script:

   ```
   node scripts/sync-github-insights.js
   ```

2. This will pull the latest changes from the repository, including any updated reports

## Using These Reports with AI

The `ai-analysis-data.md` file is specifically formatted to be easily parsed and analyzed by AI assistants. When asking the AI for insights about the project, you can direct it to review this file for up-to-date information about:

- Repository statistics
- Workflow status
- Security alerts
- Recent development activity

This allows the AI to provide more informed recommendations based on the current state of the project.
