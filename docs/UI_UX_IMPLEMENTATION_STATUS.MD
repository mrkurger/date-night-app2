## Next Steps

1. **Accessibility Improvements**

   - Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit using automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse)
   - Implement keyboard navigation improvements:
     - Ensure all interactive elements are focusable
     - Implement logical tab order
     - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
     - Ensure focus trapping in modals and dialogs
   - Add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements:
     - Use aria-label for elements without visible text
     - Use aria-expanded for expandable elements
     - Use aria-controls to associate controls with their targets
     - Use aria-live for dynamic content updates
   - Ensure proper focus management:
     - Return focus to trigger elements after modal/dialog close
     - Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
     - Implement skip links for keyboard users
   - Implement color contrast improvements:
     - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
     - Test contrast in both light and dark modes
     - Provide alternative visual indicators beyond color

2. **Consistent Application of Micro-interactions**

   - Apply hover effects to all interactive elements:
     - Use the hover-scale mixin for cards and buttons
     - Use the hover-lift mixin for elevated elements
     - Use the hover-color-shift mixin for text links
   - Add loading states to all actions:
     - Implement loading spinners for buttons
     - Add skeleton loaders for content areas
     - Provide progress indicators for multi-step processes
     - Ensure loading states are accessible
   - Implement transition effects for page changes:
     - Add fade transitions between routes
     - Implement slide transitions for related content
     - Ensure transitions respect reduced motion preferences
   - Add feedback animations for user actions:
     - Implement success/error animations for form submissions
     - Add ripple effects for button clicks
     - Provide visual feedback for drag and drop operations
     - Ensure animations are subtle and purposeful

3. **Documentation Updates**

   - Create component documentation for all components:
     - Document props/inputs with types and default values
     - Provide usage examples with code snippets
     - Document component variants and states

     - Include mobile-first implementation guidelines
     - Provide responsive testing instructions

4. **Testing**

     - Test color contrast in all component states
     - Verify focus management in complex components
   - Create responsive design test cases:
     - Test components at all breakpoints
     - Verify layout shifts are intentional and smooth
     - Test touch interactions on mobile devices
     - Verify content readability at all screen sizes
   - Test dark mode across all components:
     - Verify color contrast in dark mode
     - Test component states in dark mode
     - Verify transitions between light and dark mode
     - Test automatic dark mode based on system preferences
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation:
     - Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
     - Verify all content is announced correctly
     - Test keyboard navigation paths
     - Verify focus indicators are visible

5. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement lazy loading for components:
     - Use Angular's lazy loading for routes
     - Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
     - Use virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Optimize CSS delivery:
     - Remove unused CSS
     - Implement critical CSS
     - Use CSS containment where appropriate
   - Optimize animations:
     - Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
     - Avoid layout thrashing
     - Implement will-change for complex animations
   - Implement performance monitoring:
     - Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
     - Set up performance budgets
     - Create performance regression tests

6. **Cross-browser Compatibility**

   - Test in all major browsers:
     - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
     - Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)
   - Address browser-specific issues:
     - Implement polyfills for missing features
     - Use vendor prefixes where necessary
     - Test CSS fallbacks for unsupported features
   - Create browser compatibility documentation:
     - Document known issues and workarounds
     - Provide browser support matrix
     - Include testing instructions for different browsers
