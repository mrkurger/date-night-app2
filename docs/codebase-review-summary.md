- Comprehensive user model with role-based access (user, advertiser, admin)
- Advanced security features including password hashing with Argon2
- Device fingerprinting and IP tracking for security
- Subscription management with Stripe integration
- Safety features including emergency contacts and check-in systems

**Implementation Quality:** Excellent - The user model in `server/models/user.model.js` is comprehensive with proper validation, indexing, and security measures.

### 2. Advertisement System
**Strengths:**
- Robust ad model with media support and moderation workflow
- Geospatial indexing for location-based queries
- Engagement tracking (views, likes, swipes)
- Category-based organization
- Status management (draft, pending, active, rejected)

**Implementation Quality:** Very Good - The ad system in `server/components/ads/` demonstrates solid architecture with proper separation of concerns.

### 3. Multiple Browsing Interfaces
**Innovation Highlight:**
- **Netflix-style Grid View**: Card-based layout with hover interactions and infinite scroll
- **Tinder-style Swipe Interface**: Touch-friendly card swiping with animations
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

**Implementation Quality:** Excellent - Components like `NetflixViewComponent` and `TinderViewComponent` show sophisticated UI development.

### 4. Authentication & Security
**Strengths:**
- JWT-based authentication with token blacklisting
- Multiple OAuth providers integration
- Comprehensive middleware stack including helmet, CORS, rate limiting
- XSS and injection protection
- Session management with refresh tokens

### 5. Travel Itinerary System
**Features:**
- Location-based tracking for advertisers
- Geospatial queries for proximity matching
- Travel plan management with date ranges
- Integration with Norwegian location data

## Technical Strengths

### 1. Modern Development Practices
- **TypeScript Integration**: Mixed JS/TS codebase with proper type definitions
- **Component Architecture**: Standalone Angular components with proper dependency injection
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error middleware and validation

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexing**: Proper MongoDB indexes for geospatial and text queries
- **Lazy Loading**: Angular modules and components loaded on demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Response caching headers and cache middleware
- **Image Optimization**: Media processing pipeline with thumbnails

### 3. Security Implementation
