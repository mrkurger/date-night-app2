# Snyk Reports Initial Setup

This file is a placeholder for the Snyk security reports that will be generated by the automated workflow. Once the workflow runs, this directory will contain detailed reports on security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and licensing problems in the project's dependencies.

## Expected Reports

After the workflow runs, you will find the following reports in this directory:

1. **issues-summary.md**: A high-level overview of the current security status
2. **prioritized-issues.md**: A comprehensive list of all issues, prioritized by severity
3. **vulnerable-dependencies.md**: A focused analysis of vulnerable dependencies with upgrade paths

## Running the Workflow Manually

To generate the reports immediately, you can manually trigger the workflow:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab
3. Select the "Sync Snyk Issues" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" and select the branch to run on
5. Click "Run workflow" to start the process

## Setting Up Snyk Token

For the workflow to run successfully, you need to set up a Snyk API token:

1. Create a Snyk account at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io) if you don't have one
2. Generate an API token in your Snyk account settings
3. Add the token as a GitHub secret named `SNYK_TOKEN` in your repository settings

## Next Steps

After the reports are generated:

1. Review the summary to get an overview of the current security status
2. Address critical and high severity issues first
3. Follow the specific upgrade commands provided in the reports
4. Use the dependency upgrade plan to systematically fix vulnerable dependencies
