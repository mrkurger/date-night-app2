## Remaining Issues

1. **RxJS Compatibility Issues**

   - Global built-in functions like darken() are deprecated

5. **Service Method Issues**
   - Missing or misnamed methods in services (e.g., getCurrentUserId vs getCurrentUser)

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining RxJS compatibility issues by:
