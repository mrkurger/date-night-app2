# Duplication Prioritization Matrix

This document prioritizes the identified code duplications based on frequency, complexity, risk, and potential maintenance benefits.

## Prioritization Criteria

Each duplication is rated on a scale of 1-5 (1 = Low, 5 = High) for the following criteria:

- **Frequency**: How often the duplicated code appears in the codebase
- **Complexity**: How complex the duplicated code is
- **Risk**: The potential risk of refactoring the duplication
- **Maintenance Benefit**: The potential benefit of refactoring in terms of future maintenance

The **Total Score** is calculated as: `(Frequency + Complexity + Maintenance Benefit) - Risk`

## Recommended Phase 1 Focus

For Phase 1 of the cleanup plan, we recommend focusing on:

1. **Netflix/Tinder Component Logic**: Create a shared media browsing component
2. **Payment Method Schema**: Extract to a shared schema definition
3. **Form Validation Logic**: Create a shared form validation service
4. **HTTP Error Handling**: Implement a centralized HTTP interceptor
5. **Validation Logic**: Create shared validation utilities

These items represent a mix of client and server-side duplications with high impact and manageable risk.
