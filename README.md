# DateNight.io - Advertisement Platform

## Description

DateNight.io is a platform offering classified advertisements primarily focused on Escort, Striptease, and Massage services, initially targeting the Scandinavian market with a focus on Norway. The platform connects service providers (advertisers) with users (seekers), incorporating modern web application features like real-time chat, location-based searching, and multiple browsing interfaces.

### Key Features

- **Advertisement Platform**: Create, manage, and browse ads for escort and stripper services
- **Travel Itinerary**: Track advertisers' locations when they are actively seeking clientele
- **Real-time Chat**: Direct messaging between users and advertisers
- **Multiple Browsing Interfaces**: Traditional list/grid view, Tinder-style swipe interface, Netflix-style gallery
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles for both advertisers and users
- **Monetization**: Ad sales, fees on camshows, fees on OnlyFans-like interactions

This project uses the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

**Note:** The project has been fully migrated from AngularJS to Angular. The new Angular frontend is located in the `client-angular/` directory.

## Project Structure

The project uses a modern Angular frontend with an Express.js backend:
